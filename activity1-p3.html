                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, <strong>cream together</strong> the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and <em>fluffy</em>, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract and mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed until <strong>just combined</strong>. Do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Fold in chocolate chips and walnuts (if using) with a spatula until evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 5cm apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are <em>golden brown</em> but centers still look slightly underdone.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool completely before storing in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For extra chewy cookies, slightly underbake them and let them finish cooking on the hot baking sheet!

        <h2>Baking Terms Explained</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Cream Together</dt>
            <dd>The process of beating butter and sugar together until the mixture becomes light in color and fluffy in texture, incorporating air for lighter cookies.</dd>
            
            <dt>Room Temperature Butter</dt>
            <dd>Butter that has been left out to soften to approximately 18-20°C, soft enough to leave an indent when pressed but not melted or greasy.</dd>
            
            <dt>Fold In</dt>
            <dd>A gentle mixing technique using a spatula to incorporate ingredients without deflating the mixture, using a turning and lifting motion.</dd>
            
            <dt>Overmixing</dt>
            <dd>Mixing dough too much after flour is added, which develops gluten and can result in tough, dense cookies instead of tender ones.</dd>
            
            <dt>Wire Rack</dt>
            <dd>A metal cooling rack with a grid pattern that allows air to circulate around baked goods, preventing soggy bottoms and ensuring even cooling.</dd>
