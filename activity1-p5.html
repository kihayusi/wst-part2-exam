            <ul>
                <li>1.5 liters vegetable or chicken stock</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>40g butter, divided</li>
                <li>300g mixed mushrooms (cremini, shiitake, oyster), sliced</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>350g Arborio rice</li>
                <li>150ml dry white wine</li>
                <li>80g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh thyme sprigs (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the stock in a saucepan and keep it <strong>warm over low heat</strong> throughout the cooking process.</li>
            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and half the butter over <em>medium-high heat</em>.</li>
            <li>Add sliced mushrooms and cook for 5-6 minutes until <strong>golden brown</strong> and any liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add remaining olive oil. Sauté chopped onion for 3-4 minutes until <em>softened and translucent</em>.</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add Arborio rice and stir constantly for 2 minutes until the grains are <strong>lightly toasted</strong> and coated with oil.</li>
            <li>Pour in white wine and stir continuously until it is completely absorbed by the rice.</li>
            <li>Add one ladleful of warm stock to the rice. Stir frequently until the liquid is almost completely absorbed before adding the next ladleful. <em>Continue this process</em> for about 18-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When rice is <strong>al dente</strong> and creamy, stir in the cooked mushrooms, remaining butter, and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir vigorously for 1 minute to create a <em>creamy, flowing consistency</em>.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>

            <strong>Chef's Tip:</strong> The key to perfect risotto is patience and constant stirring. The rice should be creamy but still have a slight bite in the center!

        <h2>Risotto Terminology</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Arborio Rice</dt>
            <dd>A short-grain Italian rice with high starch content, essential for risotto's signature creamy texture. The starch is released gradually through stirring.</dd>
            
            <dt>Al Dente</dt>
            <dd>Italian term meaning the rice should be cooked through but still have a slight firmness when bitten, not mushy or hard.</dd>
            
            <dt>Toasting the Rice</dt>
            <dd>Cooking rice in oil or butter before adding liquid, which seals the grain's exterior and helps maintain texture while developing nutty flavors.</dd>
            
            <dt>Ladling Technique</dt>
            <dd>Adding warm stock gradually, one ladle at a time, allowing the rice to absorb liquid slowly. This method releases starch and creates risotto's creamy consistency.</dd>
            
            <dt>Mantecatura</dt>
            <dd>The final step of vigorously stirring in butter and cheese off the heat, creating a wave-like, flowing consistency in the finished risotto.</dd>
            
            <dt>Heavy-Bottomed Pan</dt>
            <dd>A pan with a thick base that distributes heat evenly, preventing hot spots and ensuring the risotto cooks uniformly without burning.</dd>
